# Short dashes in text

- In all projects, use **short hyphens** (`-`, minus) in running text, not long em dashes (`—`).
- Apply to: UI copy, taglines, descriptions, comments in user-facing content, meta descriptions.
- Example: "Write on Telegram - I reply to the point" not "Write on Telegram — I reply to the point".
