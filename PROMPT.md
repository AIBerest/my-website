# Prompt for personal one-page website (avatar on the left)

Create a personal one-page website with a dark theme and turquoise gradient accents.  
Use a minimalistic, modern design with smooth animations, turquoise gradient highlights, and a soft glow around active elements.  

### Requirements:
- **Background:** dark, from near-black (#0a0a0a) to deep gray (#121212).  
- **Accent:** turquoise gradient from #00FFF0 to #00B8AA.  
- **Font:** a stylish, Apple-like typeface, but free to use. Apply "Inter" or "Poppins" from Google Fonts (they are open source and free for commercial use). [Inter by rsms](https://rsms.me/inter/)
- **Layout:** the avatar and main content should be aligned to the left side of the screen on desktop, with good padding from the edges. On mobile, everything can stack nicely with some margin.  
- **Avatar:** a circular profile picture on the left (use a placeholder or "/avatar.jpg").  
- To the right of the avatar (or below it on mobile), display my name prominently.  
- Under the name, add the description text: "Crypto enthusiast and vibe coder."  
- Below that, place social links (YouTube, Telegram, Instagram) as icons or buttons. Use Font Awesome icons.  
- Add smooth fade-in animations for each element.  
- **Hover effects:** subtle turquoise glow around icons.  

The website must be fully responsive, working well on both mobile and desktop.  

Use HTML + CSS (preferably TailwindCSS) for implementation.  
At the end, include a `<head>` section with Google Font import and basic SEO meta tags.  

Don't use lorem ipsum — use the provided text exactly.
